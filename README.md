Hey, my name is Ilan
I'm a student at HackerU

the college gave me a task to build (a protfolio)/ add to the existing one
JavaScript projects

I added 6, there is a possibilty that I added more

the technology that was used in this project was HTML, CSS, SCSS / SASS, BOOTSRAP, JAVASCRIPT ,REST API

My project looks the same to the last one is because I don't have a lot of time at the moment to build a new one(I promise this is the last time you'll see it) i'm doing my reserve duty  and I have a lot of work to do with my own company as well + 7 to 4 job

I know I did the index.html wrong it's in the page folder I didn't want to touch it so I wouldn't miss something that got broken(from the alst project)

hope you enjoy it!!
