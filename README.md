Hey, my name is Ilan
I'm a student at HackerU

the college gave me a task to build (a protfolio)/ add to the existing one
JavaScript projects

I added 6 there is a possibilty that I added more

the technology that was used in this project was HTML, CSS, SCSS / SASS, BOOTSRAP, JAVASCRIPT ,REST API

My projects looks the same to the last one is because I don't have a lot of time at the moment to build a new one(I promise this is the last time you'll see it) I have a lot of work to do

hope you enjoy it!!
